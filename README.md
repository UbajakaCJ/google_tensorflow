# Google Tensorflow

## An Introduction to Neural Network Using Google's TensorFlow

Tensorflow is a framework developed by Google Brain Team for dataflow programming across a range of tasks, used also for deep learning problems such as neural networks.

Why Tensor? It’s a way of representing data in Deep Learning. A Tensor is a multi-dimensional array. It could be 1 dimensional — a single number, or 2 — a square of numbers, or 3 — a cube of numbers or as much as you can imagine.

The dimension of a Tensor is its rank.

In Tensorflow, we have constants, placeholders, and variables to define input data, class labels, weights, and biases. Constants which takes no input, stores constant values and outputs them when needed; Placeholders which allows you to feed input on the run of your computational graph. And Variables that modifies the graph such that it can produce new outputs with respect to the same inputs.

We are going to work with Fashion-MNIST dataset by Zalando to put in context our understanding of Convolutional Neural Network.
